## Project Overview 

  This project provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix’s global content catalog using SQL.
By exploring thousands of Movies and TV Shows, the goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help understand Netflix’s content strategy — such as which countries produce the most content, what genres are dominant, and how content growth has evolved.

## Project Objective

  The objective of this project is to analyze Netflix’s catalog of Movies and TV Shows using SQL.
By leveraging SQL queries, we extract insights such as:
 -Total number of movies and shows available
 -Country-wise contributions
 -Common ratings
 -Top actors, directors, and genres
 -Yearly content additions
 -And other key business metrics about Netflix’s content trends.
